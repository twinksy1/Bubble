# Bubble rendering with GLSL
> A realistic rendering of a bubble coded in C++ using the OpenGL framework and the GLSL shader language. The bubble is made up of small triangle meshes where each edge is a spring and each point connecting the triangles together is a mass. This allowed me to be able to simulate the expanding and shrinking effect bubbles inherit when floating. I added a cube map around the bubble in order to refract the world textures onto the bubble. Lastly, I added some chromatic aberration in the fragment shader to simulate the light waves that reflect on one another in real bubbles.
